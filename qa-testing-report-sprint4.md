# QA Testing Report: Sprint 4 Interactive Features
## A Moody Place - Quality Assurance Analysis

**Test Date:** September 5, 2025  
**Tester:** Senior QA Analyst (Claude)  
**Environment:** Local Development (Docker)  
**Browser:** Chrome 139.0.0.0 (Macintosh)  
**Test Scope:** Sprint 4 Interactive Features

---

## Executive Summary

Sprint 4 interactive features testing revealed **mixed results** with critical deployment and backend integration issues. While frontend JavaScript implementations are solid and user experience is excellent, several backend API endpoints are missing, causing functionality failures.

### Overall Quality Assessment: ⚠️ **REQUIRES IMMEDIATE ATTENTION**

- **Frontend Implementation:** ✅ Excellent
- **Backend Integration:** ❌ Critical Issues  
- **User Experience:** ✅ Excellent
- **Performance:** ✅ Excellent
- **Responsive Design:** ✅ Excellent

---

## Critical Issues Found

### 🚨 **Priority: CRITICAL**

#### 1. Docker Container Synchronization Issue (RESOLVED)
- **Issue:** Container was missing Sprint 4 JavaScript files
- **Impact:** Complete failure of interactive features
- **Root Cause:** Container built before Sprint 4 implementation
- **Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED** - Container rebuilt successfully
- **Files Missing:** `music-player.js`, `contact-form.js`, `gallery-lightbox.js`, `audio/` directory

#### 2. Backend API Missing - Contact Form
- **Issue:** `/api/contact/submit` returns 404 Not Found
- **Impact:** Contact form appears to work but fails silently to users
- **Evidence:** Network error displayed to user: "Network error. Please check your connection and try again."
- **Root Cause:** Current `server.js` doesn't include contact route handlers
- **Status:** ❌ **UNRESOLVED** - Critical for production

#### 3. Audio File Placeholder Issue
- **Issue:** `falling-preview.mp3` is a text file, not actual audio
- **Impact:** Music player shows error state when attempting to play
- **Evidence:** Browser error: "Failed to load because no supported source was found"
- **Status:** ❌ **UNRESOLVED** - Content issue

---

## Feature Testing Results
